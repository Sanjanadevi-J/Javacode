Static member:
       It is created by using static keyword.
       The main purpose of using static member is to manage memory ,to access static member there is no need of creating instance.
       static member may be
              -method :it will access only static field and method without instantiate the class
              - field :value cannot be changed in all instance, when a class is loaded for the first time it will be created
              - block: block of code with static keyword.Executes at runtime (i.e)before main method
       It is stored inside the class memory.
       It will be used anywhere in the class.

Non-Static member:
       It is a method or a variable without static keyword.
       It will be accessed by creating instance of class.
       It can be able to access any static methods but static can't able to access the non-static.
       It will be stored inside object memory.
       It has dynamic memory.
JVM compile steps:
       It reads the static member from top to bottom
       Executes the static member first and executes the main method.
