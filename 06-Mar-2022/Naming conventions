Naming conventions:
       It is rule a to follow, to name a class/method/package/variable/interface in a program
       It is not forced to follow, but if we fail to follow the frame the program shows error
       - class: starts with upper case,name should be a noun,camel case in case of two or more words.
       -interface:  starts with upper case,name should be a adjective,camel case in case of two or more words.
       -package: starts with lower letter, word are separated by dots.
       -method: starts with lower letter,name should be a verb, if there is two or more words new word start with uppercase.
       -variable: starts with lower letter,no special characteristics, if there is two or more words new word start with uppercase.
       -constants: all letters should be upper case , words separated by underscore.
*camel case: if we have two or more words the new word starts with upper case.

Usage of naming conventions:
       By using standard names, it makes the coder easier to read other's program and understand the program in quick manner.
       reduce read time
       To focus more on the issue or problem of the program.
