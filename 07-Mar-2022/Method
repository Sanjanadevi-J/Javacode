Method:
     It is a collection of statement or a block of code which performs specific task and it will be executed once it is called using instance of class.
     It is also called as function.
     It must be a part of class.
Usage:
     The method will be reused in the code without retyping the code.
     It saves the time.
     It also helps in maintainability.
Declaration:
     It defines with any of four modifier(default,public,private,protected)
     Next to modifier data type/ return type(void,int,float,double)
     Method name followed by data type- Starts with lower case and if more than one word it should be camelcase.
     followed by parentheses.
Types:
     Predefined - built in/standard java library, which is already defined in java.Example: print(),length().sqrt(),etc.
     User defined - we can modify according to our need.
           - Static - Method with a static keyword, it a belong to a class rather than instance of class.
           -instance - Non static method invoked by object.
                  - accessor - reads the instance of class, easily identified by get keyword.
                  - mutator - reads and make changes in the value,easily identified by set keyword.
Memory allocation:
       - implemented through stack(i.e) LIFO method.
       - stack frame is created inside the stack when a method is called. After execution allocated stack frame will be deleted.
