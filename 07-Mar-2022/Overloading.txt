Overloading:
          It allows two or more methods in a class to have a same name,but they are different parameters.
          It is also called as call by value.
          It may differ in no. of arguments, type of arguments, both
          But, if the method is different in return type only will not be overloaded it will cause error.(ambiguity occurs).
          Compile time polymorphism is done by overloading.
Ways to overload:
          change in argument.
          change in datatype.
Advantage of overloading:
          - Increases readability.
          - Reduces complexity.
          - Reduces execution time.
          - Makes code clean.
          - create many methods with same name.
