Interface:
          It is blueprint of class.
          The mechanism used to achieve 100% abstraction.
          Multiple inheritance can be achieved by interface by using implements keyword.
          It has only method declaration. The implemented interface or class can has its method definitions .
          From java 8 version, method definitions are implemented by using default and static keyword.
          We can also declare a variable inside a interface but  the variable will  be a final or static one the value can"t be changed.
Types of methods:
      Abstract,Static,Default.
      Abstract method only has method declaration inside the interface. But, static and default methods can have method definitions.

Uses:
     To achieve abstraction.
     To achieve polymorphism.
     to achieve multiple inheritance.
     Interface can extend interface.
     class can implement n number of interface.
Types:
      Functional interface- Abstract,static,default methods
      Marker interface- Empty interfaces/ no members inside the interface.
      Nested interface - Interface inside the interface.
