Constructor:
            A constructor is similar to the method,but it has the same name as class name, and it has no return type.
            It is a special method to initialize an object.
            If we have not created any constructor java calls a default constructor.
            A constructor will be called when an object is created.
            Constructor is not a member of class, but it is inside the class.
            At the time of calling an object memory will be allocated to the constructor.
            We can create many constructors by changing the number of parameters.
Types:
      Default(no-argument): without any parameters.Default constructor will pass 0 or null if the value is not assigned.
      Parameterised: assign a number of parameters to assign value to the attribute.Used to assign different values to distinct objects.
      copy: the value of another object will be passed to the constructor.
Usage:
      Main purpose of constructor is to initialize an object.
      There is no need of calling constructor . once an object is crated it automatically calls the constructor.
Constructor overloading:
      We can overload a constructor by changing the no. of arguments.
      This is achieved by parameterised constructor.
      This is used to have number of constructors with different parameter number.
