Loop:
     loop is a block of code with iteration,it will print as long as the specific condition is reached.
For-loop:
         It is an entry check loop,once we know end iteration for-loop will be used.
         It contains four parts initialization,condition,statement,increment/decrement.
         In initialization, we have to initialize the variable with a value from where to start the loop.
         In condition, we have to check the condition to enter the loop,if it fails it came out of the loop.
         Once the condition gets checked ,if it is true it will print the statement.
         after execution of the statement increment/decrement part will be executed again the loop starts its process,

syntax:
       for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement){
        //statement;
       }
Nested for-loop:
        we can have for-loop inside a for-loop ,inner loop will be executed completely for single iteration of outer loop.
For each loop:
        it is used to convert array of element to a collection
        syntax: for(datatype variable:arrayname)
