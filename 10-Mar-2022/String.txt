String:
       String is basically an object,it is used to store sequence of character.
       It is immutable (not able to modify the created string).
       we can create strings in two ways - by using literal method(using double quotes).
                                         - by using new keyword
       There are many inbuilt methods for string : length(),toUpperCase(),toLowerCase(),equals(),concat()CharAt(0,etc.
       Memory for the string will be allocated in constant-pool

StringBuffer and StringBuilder:
       We can create mutable string by using StringBuffer and StringBuilder.
       Memory will be allocated in heap.
