Arrays:
       It is a collection of similar data types of an element which has continuous memory allocation.
       We can store only fixed set of elements(i.e) the size should be fixed.
       Array out of exception happens if the array elements less than or greater than the array length.
       Memory will be dynamically allocated for an array in heap memory,
       Elements of array is based on index,the first element will be in 0th position and so on,.
       Array can be initialized , declared and instantiated together.
Advantage of array:
       code optimization
       random access
Types:
      Single dimensional array
      Multi-dimensional array-used to create matrices
Anonymous array:
      Not declaring array while passing an array.
Jagged array:
      Multidimensional array with different number of columns.
Copy array:
      we can copy an array into another array by Arraycopy().
