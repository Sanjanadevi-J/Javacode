This keyword:
            This keyword is used to refer the current object in a methods or a constructor.
            It is used to refer the current class variable.
            It is used to invoke current class method
            It is used to invoke current class constructor.
            It is used to pass the current object as an argument to a method or to a constructor.
              - this() constructor can be reused in a class constructor.
              - this() constructor should be called first in the constructor otherwise it will show compile time error.
            The main use of this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameter of a method or constructor with same name.
            It is better to use standard name for the parameters so same name of attributes is used with this keyword to avoid confusion.
